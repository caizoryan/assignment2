## Roadmap
- [ ] Connect the database to the interface
- [ ] Deploy it on digital ocean or whatever alternative we decide to go with
- [ ] Send just the "add your project" side around to people we know in order to find bugs and ways to improve the experience
  - [ ] Respond to feedback and iterate
- [ ] Upon projects being added, use that as content to design the interface of the landing page
- [ ] Push the site to be live for everyone at ocad and see what happens
